# Vrinda-Store-Data-Analysis

I have taken dataset from the Internet.
Objective:
Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022 so that the store can understand its marketing strategy and grow more sales in 2023.
Analysis:
First, I understood the data in the datasets and identified business problems.Data cleaning was performed to remove duplicates and null values, and an age group column was created from the Age column using the IF function.Created a Pivot table to summarize the data and create charts and graphs to solve business problems.Finally, I built a dashboard in Excel with slicers so that users could interact with it and view it in different ways to obtain results.
